https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes
Also, note EAP 7 soon reaches its end of life after June 2025 per https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#p_eap.  If you plan to pursue extended life support (ELS) for EAP 7 at that time, note that ELS will be limited to EAP 7.4.  Otherwise, please plan to upgrade to EAP 8 before this time for continued support.

echo "EAP 7/Undertow has a loop that can run indefinitely if the java SSLEngine returns a CLOSE/NEED_WRAP state for the handshake. That was not really ever seen with prior java versions. But java 1.8.0_361+ and 11.0.18+ and 17.0.6+ include changes that increase the possibility of SSLEngineResult.writeRecord returning a CLOSED/NEED_WRAP state for a client abruptly terminating an SSL handshake:

https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8273553

Undertow does not currently handle this state and falls into a busy loop here to consume high CPU.  You should downgrade java to 1.8.0_351 / 11.0.17 / 17.0.5 or earlier and only use these as a workaround. Then upgrade to the latest EAP 7.4.10+ updates before upgrading the JDK again.  The latest 7.4.14 update is recommended:

7.4.14: https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDetail.html?softwareId=106085"
